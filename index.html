                I Know Quratulain from the age, when girls are careless and
                irresponsible, but she was not as others. She had all the
                qualities that could make her a succcessful person in the future
                and today she proved it. She is a talented author, and a
                versatile leader. My prayers are with her as before and today
                more. Wish you Good Luck, My amazing and obedient Student.

                well-versed in 21st century dynamics of teaching, learning and
                management. The way she brings her passion, innovation and
                creativity to her ventures and projects is admirable. In fact,
                she has exhibited her transformational leadership skills in the

                Synapra will provide people an amazing and long-lasting learning

                are different. If we do not adapt education to the present, not

                jeopardize the future of our next generations. Your efforts

                Synapra, a trailblazer in the field, offers educational
                consulting in Pakistan. From its inception, Synapra redefined
                what it meant to educate and train people. Moreover, by offering
                training programs that have been approved by the UK's CPD
                standards office, Synapra is dismantling barriers and
                conventional norms in the educational field. Simply put, this
                training is focused on preparing educational leaders to better
                manage functional departments. The complete course of
                Educational Leadership is filled with a wealth of information.
                Learning information, skills, and values from such a well-known
                trainer was a wonderful experience. The combination of in-class
                exercises, challenging homework assignments, and
                thought-provoking questions helped me to better understand the
                material. I found it to be worth the value and time. highly

                Hi, I would like to express my gratitude for the wonderful
                experience I had while taking the Educational Leadership CPD
                course with your organization. The course was exceptional in
                many ways, and I appreciate all the effort put in by the
                trainers and the team. The practical approach of the course was
                really helpful in making us understand the concepts of
                educational leadership. The course provided me with the
                necessary tools and knowledge to develop these plans, which I
                believe will be of immense help in my professional career. The
                part that stood out for me the most was how the trainer
                connected every module with the examples of Islam and Islamic
                history. This not only helped me in understanding the concepts
                better, but it also made the course more relatable and
                interesting. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to
                my friend Ms. Annie Furqan and the Synapra Project Consultancy
                team. The support and guidance provided by the trainer were
                exceptional. Highly recommend this course to anyone interested
                in educational leadership.

                that it was an enriching experience that has prepared me for
                different dimensions of understanding & Growth. Throughout the
                program gained a thorough understanding of child development and
                learnt effective communication and behavior management
                strategies. It helped me to develop strong interpersonal skills
                and built positive relationships with children & families.
                Overall, the course has given me the solid foundation to work in
                ECE sector and has equipped me with the skills and knowledge
                necessary to provide quality care and education to young
                children. I would highly recommend this course to all ECE
                Practitioners. I would also like to express my appreciation for
                the Trainer Raheela Damani and Synapra who has played a crucial
                role in shaping my learning experience during ECED Course. Her
                expertise and the ways of teaching is valuable to create a
                supportive and exclusive learning environment. I am grateful for
                the guidance, support & Commitment to help me achieving my
