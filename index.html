I found her well-versed in 21st century dynamics of teaching, learning and management. The way she brings her passion, innovation and creativity to her ventures and projects is admirable. In fact, she has exhibited her transformational leadership skills in the capacity building sessions she has either organized or conducted herself in the past. Now, I’m glad to see her brainchild Synapra, and the way it is evolving. I’m sure connecting with Synapra will provide people an amazing and long-lasting learning experience In-sha-ALLAH.

The course was exceptional in many ways, and I appreciate all the effort put in by the trainers and the team.
                  
                The practical approach of the course was really helpful in making us understand the concepts of educational leadership. The course provided me with the necessary tools and knowledge to develop these plans, which I believe will be of immense help in my professional career.
                
                The part that stood out for me the most was how the trainer connected every module with the examples of Islam and Islamic history. This not only helped me in understanding the concepts better, but it also made the course more relatable and interesting.
                
                I would like to express my sincere appreciation to my friend Ms. Annie Furqan and the Synapra Project Consultancy team. The support and guidance provided by the trainer were exceptional. Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in educational leadership.</p></div>
